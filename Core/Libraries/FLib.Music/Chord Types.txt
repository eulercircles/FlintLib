What's everything one would want to know about a chord, and that a chord should do?

- We want to define a root note
- We want to know the intervals of its parts
- We want to know the inversion, and perhaps other voicings
- We want to know the on-off bits of the notes to translate it into something playable
- We want to be able to see it represented as a symbol so it's readable
- We want to be able to define a chord with a root note, a triadic quality, and extensions, not by specifying the notes individually. However, we do want it to tell us what individual notes its composed of.
- We might want a somewhat flexible text-based "code" that can be parsed to specify chords with.

Each note can be a value - 0-127
Once root note is set, other values can be calculated from intervals/voicings.

CASE-SENSITIVE
A,B,C,D,E,F,G (must be caps) - note names
%,#,b - natural, sharp, flat respectively
M,m,-,+,2,4 - Major, minor, diminished, augmented, sus2, sus4
^,7 - Major 7th, dominant 7th

C%m^ = "C minor/major 7th"
C#-7 = "C sharp diminished 7th"
